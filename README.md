**üèÅ Final Words**

As a solo participant, this hackathon journey was both challenging and incredibly rewarding. I had to wear many hats‚Äîdesigning the architecture, coding both the frontend and backend, and integrating the AI APIs. There were moments of frustration, especially with API integrations and fine-tuning the real-time feedback system, but every challenge was an opportunity to learn something new. I‚Äôm proud of how everything came together in the end. It was a great experience, and I‚Äôm excited to continue developing this project further!
